# Training a Small GPT Model with PyTorch

This repository contains scripts and utilities to train a small GPT-like language model using PyTorch. It is designed to provide an accessible starting point for understanding and experimenting with GPT model training.

## Contents

- [dataset.py](dataset.py)  
  Script for preparing and managing the dataset for training the GPT model.

- [gpt_download.py](gpt_download.py)  
  Utility script to download pre-trained weights or relevant data for initializing the model.

- [pytorch_small_gpt_model.py](pytorch_small_gpt_model.py)  
  Implementation of a small GPT model architecture using PyTorch.

- [pytorch_train.py](pytorch_train.py)  
  Script to train the GPT model using PyTorch.

- [small_gpt_model.py](small_gpt_model.py)  
  An alternate or simplified implementation of a GPT-like model.

- [train.py](train.py)  
  Script for end-to-end training of the model.

- [test.py](test.py)  
  Script to test the trained GPT model and evaluate its performance.
