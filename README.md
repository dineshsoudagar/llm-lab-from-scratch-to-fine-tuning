# LLM Lab: From Scratch to Fine-Tuning

This repository offers a comprehensive suite of resources and scripts for working with Large Language Models (LLMs). It encompasses tools for training, fine-tuning, pretraining, and inference using models like litGPT, Hugging Face Transformers, and custom GPT implementations. Leveraging frameworks such as PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, it also supports Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning of large models.
