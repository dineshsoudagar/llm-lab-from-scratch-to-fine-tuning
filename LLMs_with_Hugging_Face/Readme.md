# Pretraining Hugging Face Models

This folder contains scripts for pretraining and running inference on **Hugging Face models**. These scripts focus on pretraining models like GPT from scratch using **Hugging Face Transformers** and performing inference on the trained models.

## Contents
- [dataset.py](dataset.py)  
  Script for preparing and processing datasets for pretraining Hugging Face models.

- [inference_hf_model.py](inference_hf_model.py)  
  Script to run inference on pre-trained Hugging Face models, demonstrating the modelâ€™s capabilities.

- [pretrain_gpt_small.py](pretrain_gpt_small.py)  
  A script for pretraining small GPT models using Hugging Face Transformers.

- [train.py](train.py)  
  The main training script that orchestrates the pretraining of Hugging Face models, including configuration and model training.


This folder is focused on pretraining and fine-tuning models with **Hugging Face Transformers**. 
Feel free to explore and adapt these scripts for your own use cases or projects.
